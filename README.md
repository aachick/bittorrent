# bittorrent

`bittorrent` is a side project I am developing to improve my understanding of network communications and to learn new concepts. One of the challenges I have set myself is to implement the bittorrent protocol using ony the standard Python library.

## Implementation tracking

* ✅ Encode/decode bencoded strings
* ✅ Implement bittorrent protocol messages
* ❌ Implement tracker class
* ❌ Implement peer and peer manager classes
* ❌ Implement piece handling classes
* ✅ Implement custom exceptions
